To most people these days I am convinced that this would 100% be considered ableist and offensive in every way. However, I believe that there is power in the tongue and what you give power to.I do believe that if someone CONSTANTLY has it in their mind that they cannot do something or are handicapped because of something like adhd, it can hinder them in a lot of ways because they are thinking so negatively about what they can do just because of a diagnosis (they give the adhd power over their mind more than it would have if they tried to navigate normally speaking life saying that they can function normally). While I believe all of this, I do also believe that there are instances where this comment is just rude, like if the action shown in the content that the commenter is reacting to has nothing to do with adhd, or is not even related."

It also focuses on their disability instead of simply acknowledging that they have nice taste. ,"It's not ableist to point out a blind person's fashion sense.

","I believe this comment can be considered ableist because the commenter seems to mean well, but doesn’t quite understand that the person with the disability doesn’t really have a choice in being disabled or not.
